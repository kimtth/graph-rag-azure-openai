At the ominous\nword 'liberality' Scrooge frowned, and shook his head, and handed the\ncredentials back.\n\n'At this festive season of the year, Mr. Scrooge,' said the gentleman,\ntaking up a pen, 'it is more than usually desirable that we should make\nsome slight provision for the poor and destitute, who suffer greatly at\nthe present time. Many thousands are in want of common necessaries;\nhundreds of thousands are in want of common comforts, sir.'\n\n'Are there no prisons?' asked Scrooge.\n\n'Plenty of prisons,' said the gentleman, laying down the pen again.\n\n'And the Union workhouses?' demanded Scrooge. 'Are they still in\noperation?'\n\n'They are. Still,' returned the gentleman, 'I wish I could say they were\nnot.'\n\n'The Treadmill and the Poor Law are in full vigour, then?' said Scrooge.\n\n'Both very busy, sir.'\n\n'Oh! I was afraid, from what you said at first, that something had\noccurred to stop them in their useful course,' said Scrooge. 'I am very\nglad to hear it.'\n\n'Under the impression that they scarcely furnish Christian cheer of mind\nor body to the multitude,' returned the gentleman, 'a few of us are\nendeavouring to raise a fund to buy the Poor some meat and drink, and\nmeans of warmth. We choose this time, because it is a time, of all\nothers, when Want is keenly felt, and Abundance rejoices. What shall I\nput you down for?'\n\n'Nothing!' Scrooge replied.\n\n'You wish to be anonymous?'\n\n'I wish to be left alone,' said Scrooge. 'Since you ask me what I wish,\ngentlemen, that is my answer. I don't make merry myself at Christmas,\nand I can't afford to make idle people merry. I help to support the\nestablishments I have mentioned--they cost enough: and those who are\nbadly off must go there.'\n\n'Many can't go there; and many would rather die.'\n\n'If they would rather die,' said Scrooge, 'they had better do it, and\ndecrease the surplus population. Besides--excuse me--I don't know that.'\n\n'But you might know it,' observed the gentleman.\n\n'It's not my business,' Scrooge returned. 'It's enough for a man to\nunderstand his own business, and not to interfere with other people's.\nMine occupies me constantly. Good afternoon, gentlemen!'\n\nSeeing clearly that it would be useless to pursue their point, the\ngentlemen withdrew. Scrooge resumed his labours with an improved opinion\nof himself, and in a more facetious temper than was usual with him.\n\nMeanwhile the fog and darkness thickened so, that people ran about with\nflaring links, proffering their services to go before horses in\ncarriages, and conduct them on their way. The ancient tower of a church,\nwhose gruff old bell was always peeping slyly down at Scrooge out of a\nGothic window in the wall, became invisible, and struck the hours and\nquarters in the clouds, with tremulous vibrations afterwards, as if its\nteeth were chattering in its frozen head up there. The cold became\nintense. In the main street, at the corner of the court, some labourers\nwere repairing the gas-pipes, and had lighted a great fire in a brazier,\nround which a party of ragged men and boys were gathered: warming their\nhands and winking their eyes before the blaze in rapture. The water-plug\nbeing left in solitude, its overflowings suddenly congealed, and turned\nto misanthropic ice. The brightness of the shops, where holly sprigs and\nberries crackled in the lamp heat of the windows, made pale faces ruddy\nas they passed. Poulterers' and grocers' trades became a splendid joke:\na glorious pageant, with which it was next to impossible to believe that\nsuch dull principles as bargain and sale had anything to do. The Lord\nMayor, in the stronghold of the mighty Mansion House, gave orders to his\nfifty cooks and butlers to keep Christmas as a Lord Mayor's household\nshould; and even the little tailor, whom he had fined five shillings on\nthe previous Monday for being drunk and bloodthirsty in the streets,\nstirred up to-morrow's pudding in his garret, while his lean wife and\nthe baby sallied out to buy the beef.\n\nFoggier yet, and colder! Piercing, searching, biting cold. If the good\nSt. Dunstan had but nipped the Evil Spirit's nose with a touch of such\nweather as that, instead of using his familiar weapons, then indeed he\nwould have roared to lusty purpose. The owner of one scant young nose,\ngnawed and mumbled by the hungry cold as bones are gnawed by dogs,\nstooped down at Scrooge's keyhole to regale him with a Christmas carol;\nbut, at the first sound of\n\n  'God bless you, merry gentleman,\n  May nothing you dismay!'\n\nScrooge seized the ruler with such energy of action that the singer fled\nin terror, leaving the keyhole to the fog, and even more congenial\nfrost.\n\n"

Is it a foot or a\nclaw?'\n\n'It might be a claw, for the flesh there is upon it,' was the Spirit's\nsorrowful reply. 'Look here!'\n\nFrom the foldings of its robe it brought two children, wretched, abject,\nfrightful, hideous, miserable. They knelt down at its feet, and clung\nupon the outside of its garment.\n\n'O Man! look here! Look, look down here!' exclaimed the Ghost.\n\nThey were a boy and girl. Yellow, meagre, ragged, scowling, wolfish, but\nprostrate, too, in their humility. Where graceful youth should have\nfilled their features out, and touched them with its freshest tints, a\nstale and shrivelled hand, like that of age, had pinched and twisted\nthem, and pulled them into shreds. Where angels might have sat\nenthroned, devils lurked, and glared out menacing. No change, no\ndegradation, no perversion of humanity in any grade, through all the\nmysteries of wonderful creation, has monsters half so horrible and\ndread.\n\nScrooge started back, appalled. Having them shown to him in this way, he\ntried to say they were fine children, but the words choked themselves,\nrather than be parties to a lie of such enormous magnitude.\n\n'Spirit! are they yours?' Scrooge could say no more.\n\n'They are Man's,' said the Spirit, looking down upon them. 'And they\ncling to me, appealing from their fathers. This boy is Ignorance. This\ngirl is Want. Beware of them both, and all of their degree, but most of\nall beware this boy, for on his brow I see that written which is Doom,\nunless the writing be erased. Deny it!' cried the Spirit, stretching out\nhis hand towards the city. 'Slander those who tell it ye! Admit it for\nyour factious purposes, and make it worse! And bide the end!'\n\n'Have they no refuge or resource?' cried Scrooge.\n\n'Are there no prisons?' said the Spirit, turning on him for the last\ntime with his own words. 'Are there no workhouses?'\n\nThe bell struck Twelve.\n\nScrooge looked about him for the Ghost, and saw it not. As the last\nstroke ceased to vibrate, he remembered the prediction of old Jacob\nMarley, and, lifting up his eyes, beheld a solemn Phantom, draped and\nhooded, coming like a mist along the ground towards him.\n\n\nSTAVE FOUR\n\n\n\n\nTHE LAST OF THE SPIRITS\n\n\nThe Phantom slowly, gravely, silently approached. When it came near him,\nScrooge bent down upon his knee; for in the very air through which this\nSpirit moved it seemed to scatter gloom and mystery.\n\nIt was shrouded in a deep black garment, which concealed its head, its\nface, its form, and left nothing of it visible, save one outstretched\nhand. But for this, it would have been difficult to detach its figure\nfrom the night, and separate it from the darkness by which it was\nsurrounded.\n\nHe felt that it was tall and stately when it came beside him, and that\nits mysterious presence filled him with a solemn dread. He knew no more,\nfor the Spirit neither spoke nor moved.\n\n'I am in the presence of the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come?' said\nScrooge.\n\nThe Spirit answered not, but pointed onward with its hand.\n\n'You are about to show me shadows of the things that have not happened,\nbut will happen in the time before us,' Scrooge pursued. 'Is that so,\nSpirit?'\n\nThe upper portion of the garment was contracted for an instant in its\nfolds, as if the Spirit had inclined its head. That was the only answer\nhe received.\n\nAlthough well used to ghostly company by this time, Scrooge feared the\nsilent shape so much that his legs trembled beneath him, and he found\nthat he could hardly stand when he prepared to follow it. The Spirit\npaused a moment, as observing his condition, and giving him time to\nrecover.\n\nBut Scrooge was all the worse for this. It thrilled him with a vague,\nuncertain horror to know that, behind the dusky shroud, there were\nghostly eyes intently fixed upon him, while he, though he stretched his\nown to the utmost, could see nothing but a spectral hand and one great\nheap of black.\n\n'Ghost of the Future!' he exclaimed, 'I fear you more than any spectre\nI have seen. But as I know your purpose is to do me good, and as I hope\nto live to be another man from what I was, I am prepared to bear your\ncompany, and do it with a thankful heart. Will you not speak to me?'\n\nIt gave him no reply. The hand was pointed straight before them.\n\n'Lead on!' said Scrooge. 'Lead on! The night is waning fast, and it is\nprecious time to me, I know. Lead on, Spirit!'\n\nThe Phantom moved away as it had come towards him. Scrooge followed in\nthe shadow of its dress, which bore him up, he thought, and carried him\nalong.\n\nThey scarcely seemed to enter the City; for the City rather seemed to\nspring up about them, and encompass them of its own act. But there they\nwere in the heart of it; on 'Change, amongst the merchants,"

				"text": " saw his new-born resolutions carried out\nin this.\n\nQuiet and dark, beside him stood the Phantom, with its outstretched\nhand. When he roused himself from his thoughtful quest, he fancied,\nfrom the turn of the hand, and its situation in reference to himself,\nthat the Unseen Eyes were looking at him keenly. It made him shudder,\nand feel very cold.\n\nThey left the busy scene, and went into an obscure part of the town,\nwhere Scrooge had never penetrated before, although he recognised its\nsituation and its bad repute. The ways were foul and narrow; the shop\nand houses wretched; the people half naked, drunken, slipshod, ugly.\nAlleys and archways, like so many cesspools, disgorged their offences of\nsmell and dirt, and life upon the straggling streets; and the whole\nquarter reeked with crime, with filth, and misery.\n\nFar in this den of infamous resort, there was a low-browed, beetling\nshop, below a penthouse roof, where iron, old rags, bottles, bones, and\ngreasy offal were bought. Upon the floor within were piled up heaps of\nrusty keys, nails, chains, hinges, files, scales, weights, and refuse\niron of all kinds. Secrets that few would like to scrutinise were bred\nand hidden in mountains of unseemly rags, masses of corrupted fat, and\nsepulchres of bones. Sitting in among the wares he dealt in, by a\ncharcoal stove made of old bricks, was a grey-haired rascal, nearly\nseventy years of age, who had screened himself from the cold air without\nby a frouzy curtaining of miscellaneous tatters hung upon a line and\nsmoked his pipe in all the luxury of calm retirement.\n\nScrooge and the Phantom came into the presence of this man, just as a\nwoman with a heavy bundle slunk into the shop. But she had scarcely\nentered, when another woman, similarly laden, came in too; and she was\nclosely followed by a man in faded black, who was no less startled by\nthe sight of them than they had been upon the recognition of each other.\nAfter a short period of blank astonishment, in which the old man with\nthe pipe had joined them, they all three burst into a laugh.\n\n'Let the charwoman alone to be the first!' cried she who had entered\nfirst. 'Let the laundress alone to be the second; and let the\nundertaker's man alone to be the third. Look here, old Joe, here's a\nchance! If we haven't all three met here without meaning it!'\n\n'You couldn't have met in a better place,' said old Joe, removing his\npipe from his mouth. 'Come into the parlour. You were made free of it\nlong ago, you know; and the other two an't strangers. Stop till I shut\nthe door of the shop. Ah! how it skreeks! There an't such a rusty bit of\nmetal in the place as its own hinges, I believe; and I'm sure there's no\nsuch old bones here as mine. Ha! ha! We're all suitable to our calling,\nwe're well matched. Come into the parlour. Come into the parlour.'\n\nThe parlour was the space behind the screen of rags. The old man raked\nthe fire together with an old stair-rod, and having trimmed his smoky\nlamp (for it was night) with the stem of his pipe, put it into his mouth\nagain.\n\nWhile he did this, the woman who had already spoken threw her bundle on\nthe floor, and sat down in a flaunting manner on a stool, crossing her\nelbows on her knees, and looking with a bold defiance at the other two.\n\n'What odds, then? What odds, Mrs. Dilber?' said the woman. 'Every person\nhas a right to take care of themselves. _He_ always did!'\n\n'That's true, indeed!' said the laundress. 'No man more so.'\n\n'Why, then, don't stand staring as if you was afraid, woman! Who's the\nwiser? We're not going to pick holes in each other's coats, I suppose?'\n\n'No, indeed!' said Mrs. Dilber and the man together. 'We should hope\nnot.'\n\n'Very well then!' cried the woman. 'That's enough. Who's the worse for\nthe loss of a few things like these? Not a dead man, I suppose?'\n\n'No, indeed,' said Mrs. Dilber, laughing.\n\n'If he wanted to keep 'em after he was dead, a wicked old screw,'\npursued the woman, 'why wasn't he natural in his lifetime? If he had\nbeen, he'd have had somebody to look after him when he was struck with\nDeath, instead of lying gasping out his last there, alone by himself.'\n\n'It's the truest word that ever was spoke,' said Mrs. Dilber. 'It's a\njudgment on him.'\n\n'I wish it was a little heavier judgment,' replied the woman: 'and it\nshould have been, you may depend upon it, if I could have laid my hands\non anything else. Open that bundle, old Joe, and let me know the value\nof it. Speak out plain. I'm not afraid to be the first, nor afraid for\nthem to see it. We knew pretty well that we were helping ourselves\nbefore we met here, I believe. It's no sin. Open the bundle, Joe.'\n\nBut"

Why was he rejoiced beyond all bounds to see them? Why\ndid his cold eye glisten, and his heart leap up as they went past? Why\nwas he filled with gladness when he heard them give each other Merry\nChristmas, as they parted at cross-roads and by-ways for their several\nhomes? What was merry Christmas to Scrooge? Out upon merry Christmas!\nWhat good had it ever done to him?\n\n'The school is not quite deserted,' said the Ghost. 'A solitary child,\nneglected by his friends, is left there still.'\n\nScrooge said he knew it. And he sobbed.\n\nThey left the high-road by a well-remembered lane and soon approached a\nmansion of dull red brick, with a little weather-cock surmounted cupola\non the roof, and a bell hanging in it. It was a large house, but one of\nbroken fortunes; for the spacious offices were little used, their walls\nwere damp and mossy, their windows broken, and their gates decayed.\nFowls clucked and strutted in the stables; and the coach-houses and\nsheds were overrun with grass. Nor was it more retentive of its ancient\nstate within; for, entering the dreary hall, and glancing through the\nopen doors of many rooms, they found them poorly furnished, cold, and\nvast. There was an earthy savour in the air, a chilly bareness in the\nplace, which associated itself somehow with too much getting up by\ncandle light and not too much to eat.\n\nThey went, the Ghost and Scrooge, across the hall, to a door at the back\nof the house. It opened before them, and disclosed a long, bare,\nmelancholy room, made barer still by lines of plain deal forms and\ndesks. At one of these a lonely boy was reading near a feeble fire; and\nScrooge sat down upon a form, and wept to see his poor forgotten self as\nhe had used to be.\n\nNot a latent echo in the house, not a squeak and scuffle from the mice\nbehind the panelling, not a drip from the half-thawed waterspout in the\ndull yard behind, not a sigh among the leafless boughs of one despondent\npoplar, not the idle swinging of an empty storehouse door, no, not a\nclicking in the fire, but fell upon the heart of Scrooge with softening\ninfluence, and gave a freer passage to his tears.\n\nThe Spirit touched him on the arm, and pointed to his younger self,\nintent upon his reading. Suddenly a man in foreign garments, wonderfully\nreal and distinct to look at, stood outside the window, with an axe\nstuck in his belt, and leading by the bridle an ass laden with wood.\n\n'Why, it's Ali Baba!' Scrooge exclaimed in ecstasy. 'It's dear old\nhonest Ali Baba! Yes, yes, I know. One Christmas-time, when yonder\nsolitary child was left here all alone, he _did_ come, for the first\ntime, just like that. Poor boy! And Valentine,' said Scrooge, 'and his\nwild brother, Orson; there they go! And what's his name, who was put\ndown in his drawers, asleep, at the gate of Damascus; don't you see him?\nAnd the Sultan's Groom turned upside down by the Genii; there he is upon\nhis head! Serve him right! I'm glad of it. What business had he to be\nmarried to the Princess?'\n\nTo hear Scrooge expending all the earnestness of his nature on such\nsubjects, in a most extraordinary voice between laughing and crying; and\nto see his heightened and excited face; would have been a surprise to\nhis business friends in the City, indeed.\n\n'There's the Parrot!' cried Scrooge. 'Green body and yellow tail, with a\nthing like a lettuce growing out of the top of his head; there he is!\nPoor Robin Crusoe he called him, when he came home again after sailing\nround the island. \"Poor Robin Crusoe, where have you been, Robin\nCrusoe?\" The man thought he was dreaming, but he wasn't. It was the\nParrot, you know. There goes Friday, running for his life to the little\ncreek! Halloa! Hoop! Halloo!'\n\nThen, with a rapidity of transition very foreign to his usual character,\nhe said, in pity for his former self, 'Poor boy!' and cried again.\n\n'I wish,' Scrooge muttered, putting his hand in his pocket, and looking\nabout him, after drying his eyes with his cuff; 'but it's too late now.'\n\n'What is the matter?' asked the Spirit.\n\n'Nothing,' said Scrooge. 'Nothing. There was a boy singing a Christmas\ncarol at my door last night. I should like to have given him something:\nthat's all.'\n\nThe Ghost smiled thoughtfully, and waved its hand, saying as it did so,\n'Let us see another Christmas!'\n\nScrooge's former self grew larger at the words, and the room became a\nlittle darker and more dirty.

Key entities include Marley's Ghost, the Ghost of Christmas Past, and the Church, all of which play significant roles in Scrooge's transformative journey. The relationships between these entities and Scrooge highlight the interconnectedness of the supernatural events and their impact on Scrooge's life.\n\n## Ebenezer Scrooge as the central figure\n\nEbenezer Scrooge is the main character around whom the entire community revolves. He is the recipient of supernatural visitations that significantly impact his life. Scrooge's interactions with various entities, such as Marley's Ghost and the Ghost of Christmas Past, are pivotal moments that drive the narrative forward. These visitations occur in his bedroom in London, emphasizing the personal and intimate nature of his experiences [Data: Entities (35, 40, 39); Relationships (3, 27, 50, 56, 38, 57, 58)].\n\n## Marley's Ghost's warning\n\nMarley's Ghost is a crucial entity that haunts Scrooge and warns him of future visitations. This encounter serves as a significant event, causing Scrooge to question his senses and reality. Marley's Ghost's appearance sets the stage for the transformative experiences that follow, making it a key moment in the narrative [Data: Entities (8); Relationships (3, 38)].\n\n## The Ghost of Christmas Past's role\n\nThe Ghost of Christmas Past is another supernatural visitor that appears to Scrooge. This enigmatic figure shows Scrooge scenes from his past, providing insight into his earlier life and the events that shaped him. The Ghost's visit is a critical moment that helps Scrooge reflect on his actions and their consequences, contributing to his eventual transformation [Data: Entities (38); Relationships (27, 56)].\n\n## The significance of the Church\n\nThe Church is a notable landmark in the community, with its chimes being heard by Scrooge.

At the ominous\nword 'liberality' Scrooge frowned, and shook his head, and handed the\ncredentials back.\n\n'At this festive season of the year, Mr. Scrooge,' said the gentleman,\ntaking up a pen, 'it is more than usually desirable that we should make\nsome slight provision for the poor and destitute, who suffer greatly at\nthe present time. Many thousands are in want of common necessaries;\nhundreds of thousands are in want of common comforts, sir.'\n\n'Are there no prisons?' asked Scrooge.\n\n'Plenty of prisons,' said the gentleman, laying down the pen again.\n\n'And the Union workhouses?' demanded Scrooge. 'Are they still in\noperation?'\n\n'They are. Still,' returned the gentleman, 'I wish I could say they were\nnot.'\n\n'The Treadmill and the Poor Law are in full vigour, then?' said Scrooge.\n\n'Both very busy, sir.'\n\n'Oh! I was afraid, from what you said at first, that something had\noccurred to stop them in their useful course,' said Scrooge. 'I am very\nglad to hear it.'\n\n'Under the impression that they scarcely furnish Christian cheer of mind\nor body to the multitude,' returned the gentleman, 'a few of us are\nendeavouring to raise a fund to buy the Poor some meat and drink, and\nmeans of warmth. We choose this time, because it is a time, of all\nothers, when Want is keenly felt, and Abundance rejoices. What shall I\nput you down for?'\n\n'Nothing!' Scrooge replied.\n\n'You wish to be anonymous?'\n\n'I wish to be left alone,' said Scrooge. 'Since you ask me what I wish,\ngentlemen, that is my answer. I don't make merry myself at Christmas,\nand I can't afford to make idle people merry. I help to support the\nestablishments I have mentioned--they cost enough: and those who are\nbadly off must go there.'\n\n'Many can't go there; and many would rather die.'\n\n'If they would rather die,' said Scrooge, 'they had better do it, and\ndecrease the surplus population. Besides--excuse me--I don't know that.'\n\n'But you might know it,' observed the gentleman.\n\n'It's not my business,' Scrooge returned. 'It's enough for a man to\nunderstand his own business, and not to interfere with other people's.\nMine occupies me constantly. Good afternoon, gentlemen!'\n\nSeeing clearly that it would be useless to pursue their point, the\ngentlemen withdrew. Scrooge resumed his labours with an improved opinion\nof himself, and in a more facetious temper than was usual with him.\n\nMeanwhile the fog and darkness thickened so, that people ran about with\nflaring links, proffering their services to go before horses in\ncarriages, and conduct them on their way. The ancient tower of a church,\nwhose gruff old bell was always peeping slyly down at Scrooge out of a\nGothic window in the wall, became invisible, and struck the hours and\nquarters in the clouds, with tremulous vibrations afterwards, as if its\nteeth were chattering in its frozen head up there. The cold became\nintense. In the main street, at the corner of the court, some labourers\nwere repairing the gas-pipes, and had lighted a great fire in a brazier,\nround which a party of ragged men and boys were gathered: warming their\nhands and winking their eyes before the blaze in rapture. The water-plug\nbeing left in solitude, its overflowings suddenly congealed, and turned\nto misanthropic ice. The brightness of the shops, where holly sprigs and\nberries crackled in the lamp heat of the windows, made pale faces ruddy\nas they passed. Poulterers' and grocers' trades became a splendid joke:\na glorious pageant, with which it was next to impossible to believe that\nsuch dull principles as bargain and sale had anything to do. The Lord\nMayor, in the stronghold of the mighty Mansion House, gave orders to his\nfifty cooks and butlers to keep Christmas as a Lord Mayor's household\nshould; and even the little tailor, whom he had fined five shillings on\nthe previous Monday for being drunk and bloodthirsty in the streets,\nstirred up to-morrow's pudding in his garret, while his lean wife and\nthe baby sallied out to buy the beef.\n\nFoggier yet, and colder! Piercing, searching, biting cold. If the good\nSt. Dunstan had but nipped the Evil Spirit's nose with a touch of such\nweather as that, instead of using his familiar weapons, then indeed he\nwould have roared to lusty purpose. The owner of one scant young nose,\ngnawed and mumbled by the hungry cold as bones are gnawed by dogs,\nstooped down at Scrooge's keyhole to regale him with a Christmas carol;\nbut, at the first sound of\n\n  'God bless you, merry gentleman,\n  May nothing you dismay!'\n\nScrooge seized the ruler with such energy of action that the singer fled\nin terror, leaving the keyhole to the fog, and even more congenial\nfrost.\n\n\n5|\nintently at the Spirit's robe, 'but I see something strange, and not\nbelonging to yourself, protruding from your skirts. Is it a foot or a\nclaw?'\n\n'It might be a claw, for the flesh there is upon it,' was the Spirit's\nsorrowful reply. 'Look here!'\n\nFrom the foldings of its robe it brought two children, wretched, abject,\nfrightful, hideous, miserable. They knelt down at its feet, and clung\nupon the outside of its garment.\n\n'O Man! look here! Look, look down here!' exclaimed the Ghost.\n\nThey were a boy and girl. Yellow, meagre, ragged, scowling, wolfish, but\nprostrate, too, in their humility. Where graceful youth should have\nfilled their features out, and touched them with its freshest tints, a\nstale and shrivelled hand, like that of age, had pinched and twisted\nthem, and pulled them into shreds. Where angels might have sat\nenthroned, devils lurked, and glared out menacing. No change, no\ndegradation, no perversion of humanity in any grade, through all the\nmysteries of wonderful creation, has monsters half so horrible and\ndread.\n\nScrooge started back, appalled. Having them shown to him in this way, he\ntried to say they were fine children, but the words choked themselves,\nrather than be parties to a lie of such enormous magnitude.\n\n'Spirit! are they yours?' Scrooge could say no more.\n\n'They are Man's,' said the Spirit, looking down upon them. 'And they\ncling to me, appealing from their fathers. This boy is Ignorance. This\ngirl is Want. Beware of them both, and all of their degree, but most of\nall beware this boy, for on his brow I see that written which is Doom,\nunless the writing be erased. Deny it!' cried the Spirit, stretching out\nhis hand towards the city. 'Slander those who tell it ye! Admit it for\nyour factious purposes, and make it worse! And bide the end!'\n\n'Have they no refuge or resource?' cried Scrooge.\n\n'Are there no prisons?' said the Spirit, turning on him for the last\ntime with his own words. 'Are there no workhouses?'\n\nThe bell struck Twelve.\n\nScrooge looked about him for the Ghost, and saw it not. As the last\nstroke ceased to vibrate, he remembered the prediction of old Jacob\nMarley, and, lifting up his eyes, beheld a solemn Phantom, draped and\nhooded, coming like a mist along the ground towards him.\n\n\nSTAVE FOUR\n\n\n\n\nTHE LAST OF THE SPIRITS\n\n\nThe Phantom slowly, gravely, silently approached. When it came near him,\nScrooge bent down upon his knee; for in the very air through which this\nSpirit moved it seemed to scatter gloom and mystery.\n\nIt was shrouded in a deep black garment, which concealed its head, its\nface, its form, and left nothing of it visible, save one outstretched\nhand. But for this, it would have been difficult to detach its figure\nfrom the night, and separate it from the darkness by which it was\nsurrounded.\n\nHe felt that it was tall and stately when it came beside him, and that\nits mysterious presence filled him with a solemn dread. He knew no more,\nfor the Spirit neither spoke nor moved.\n\n'I am in the presence of the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come?' said\nScrooge.\n\nThe Spirit answered not, but pointed onward with its hand.\n\n'You are about to show me shadows of the things that have not happened,\nbut will happen in the time before us,' Scrooge pursued. 'Is that so,\nSpirit?'\n\nThe upper portion of the garment was contracted for an instant in its\nfolds, as if the Spirit had inclined its head. That was the only answer\nhe received.\n\nAlthough well used to ghostly company by this time, Scrooge feared the\nsilent shape so much that his legs trembled beneath him, and he found\nthat he could hardly stand when he prepared to follow it. The Spirit\npaused a moment, as observing his condition, and giving him time to\nrecover.\n\nBut Scrooge was all the worse for this. It thrilled him with a vague,\nuncertain horror to know that, behind the dusky shroud, there were\nghostly eyes intently fixed upon him, while he, though he stretched his\nown to the utmost, could see nothing but a spectral hand and one great\nheap of black.\n\n'Ghost of the Future!' he exclaimed, 'I fear you more than any spectre\nI have seen. But as I know your purpose is to do me good, and as I hope\nto live to be another man from what I was, I am prepared to bear your\ncompany, and do it with a thankful heart. Will you not speak to me?'\n\nIt gave him no reply. The hand was pointed straight before them.\n\n'Lead on!' said Scrooge. 'Lead on! The night is waning fast, and it is\nprecious time to me, I know. Lead on, Spirit!'\n\nThe Phantom moved away as it had come towards him. Scrooge followed in\nthe shadow of its dress, which bore him up, he thought, and carried him\nalong.\n\nThey scarcely seemed to enter the City; for the City rather seemed to\nspring up about them, and encompass them of its own act. But there they\nwere in the heart of it; on 'Change, amongst the merchants,\n6| saw his new-born resolutions carried out\nin this.\n\nQuiet and dark, beside him stood the Phantom, with its outstretched\nhand. When he roused himself from his thoughtful quest, he fancied,\nfrom the turn of the hand, and its situation in reference to himself,\nthat the Unseen Eyes were looking at him keenly. It made him shudder,\nand feel very cold.\n\nThey left the busy scene, and went into an obscure part of the town,\nwhere Scrooge had never penetrated before, although he recognised its\nsituation and its bad repute. The ways were foul and narrow; the shop\nand houses wretched; the people half naked, drunken, slipshod, ugly.\nAlleys and archways, like so many cesspools, disgorged their offences of\nsmell and dirt, and life upon the straggling streets; and the whole\nquarter reeked with crime, with filth, and misery.\n\nFar in this den of infamous resort, there was a low-browed, beetling\nshop, below a penthouse roof, where iron, old rags, bottles, bones, and\ngreasy offal were bought. Upon the floor within were piled up heaps of\nrusty keys, nails, chains, hinges, files, scales, weights, and refuse\niron of all kinds. Secrets that few would like to scrutinise were bred\nand hidden in mountains of unseemly rags, masses of corrupted fat, and\nsepulchres of bones. Sitting in among the wares he dealt in, by a\ncharcoal stove made of old bricks, was a grey-haired rascal, nearly\nseventy years of age, who had screened himself from the cold air without\nby a frouzy curtaining of miscellaneous tatters hung upon a line and\nsmoked his pipe in all the luxury of calm retirement.\n\nScrooge and the Phantom came into the presence of this man, just as a\nwoman with a heavy bundle slunk into the shop. But she had scarcely\nentered, when another woman, similarly laden, came in too; and she was\nclosely followed by a man in faded black, who was no less startled by\nthe sight of them than they had been upon the recognition of each other.\nAfter a short period of blank astonishment, in which the old man with\nthe pipe had joined them, they all three burst into a laugh.\n\n'Let the charwoman alone to be the first!' cried she who had entered\nfirst. 'Let the laundress alone to be the second; and let the\nundertaker's man alone to be the third. Look here, old Joe, here's a\nchance! If we haven't all three met here without meaning it!'\n\n'You couldn't have met in a better place,' said old Joe, removing his\npipe from his mouth. 'Come into the parlour. You were made free of it\nlong ago, you know; and the other two an't strangers. Stop till I shut\nthe door of the shop. Ah! how it skreeks! There an't such a rusty bit of\nmetal in the place as its own hinges, I believe; and I'm sure there's no\nsuch old bones here as mine. Ha! ha! We're all suitable to our calling,\nwe're well matched. Come into the parlour. Come into the parlour.'\n\nThe parlour was the space behind the screen of rags. The old man raked\nthe fire together with an old stair-rod, and having trimmed his smoky\nlamp (for it was night) with the stem of his pipe, put it into his mouth\nagain.\n\nWhile he did this, the woman who had already spoken threw her bundle on\nthe floor, and sat down in a flaunting manner on a stool, crossing her\nelbows on her knees, and looking with a bold defiance at the other two.\n\n'What odds, then? What odds, Mrs. Dilber?' said the woman. 'Every person\nhas a right to take care of themselves. _He_ always did!'\n\n'That's true, indeed!' said the laundress. 'No man more so.'\n\n'Why, then, don't stand staring as if you was afraid, woman! Who's the\nwiser? We're not going to pick holes in each other's coats, I suppose?'\n\n'No, indeed!' said Mrs. Dilber and the man together. 'We should hope\nnot.'\n\n'Very well then!' cried the woman. 'That's enough. Who's the worse for\nthe loss of a few things like these? Not a dead man, I suppose?'\n\n'No, indeed,' said Mrs. Dilber, laughing.\n\n'If he wanted to keep 'em after he was dead, a wicked old screw,'\npursued the woman, 'why wasn't he natural in his lifetime? If he had\nbeen, he'd have had somebody to look after him when he was struck with\nDeath, instead of lying gasping out his last there, alone by himself.'\n\n'It's the truest word that ever was spoke,' said Mrs. Dilber. 'It's a\njudgment on him.'\n\n'I wish it was a little heavier judgment,' replied the woman: 'and it\nshould have been, you may depend upon it, if I could have laid my hands\non anything else. Open that bundle, old Joe, and let me know the value\nof it. Speak out plain. I'm not afraid to be the first, nor afraid for\nthem to see it. We knew pretty well that we were helping ourselves\nbefore we met here, I believe. It's no sin. Open the bundle, Joe.'\n\nBut\n4| that the crisp air laughed to hear it.\n\n'These are but shadows of the things that have been,' said the Ghost.\n'They have no consciousness of us.'\n\nThe jocund travellers came on; and as they came, Scrooge knew and named\nthem every one. Why was he rejoiced beyond all bounds to see them? Why\ndid his cold eye glisten, and his heart leap up as they went past? Why\nwas he filled with gladness when he heard them give each other Merry\nChristmas, as they parted at cross-roads and by-ways for their several\nhomes? What was merry Christmas to Scrooge? Out upon merry Christmas!\nWhat good had it ever done to him?\n\n'The school is not quite deserted,' said the Ghost. 'A solitary child,\nneglected by his friends, is left there still.'\n\nScrooge said he knew it. And he sobbed.\n\nThey left the high-road by a well-remembered lane and soon approached a\nmansion of dull red brick, with a little weather-cock surmounted cupola\non the roof, and a bell hanging in it. It was a large house, but one of\nbroken fortunes; for the spacious offices were little used, their walls\nwere damp and mossy, their windows broken, and their gates decayed.\nFowls clucked and strutted in the stables; and the coach-houses and\nsheds were overrun with grass. Nor was it more retentive of its ancient\nstate within; for, entering the dreary hall, and glancing through the\nopen doors of many rooms, they found them poorly furnished, cold, and\nvast. There was an earthy savour in the air, a chilly bareness in the\nplace, which associated itself somehow with too much getting up by\ncandle light and not too much to eat.\n\nThey went, the Ghost and Scrooge, across the hall, to a door at the back\nof the house. It opened before them, and disclosed a long, bare,\nmelancholy room, made barer still by lines of plain deal forms and\ndesks. At one of these a lonely boy was reading near a feeble fire; and\nScrooge sat down upon a form, and wept to see his poor forgotten self as\nhe had used to be.\n\nNot a latent echo in the house, not a squeak and scuffle from the mice\nbehind the panelling, not a drip from the half-thawed waterspout in the\ndull yard behind, not a sigh among the leafless boughs of one despondent\npoplar, not the idle swinging of an empty storehouse door, no, not a\nclicking in the fire, but fell upon the heart of Scrooge with softening\ninfluence, and gave a freer passage to his tears.\n\nThe Spirit touched him on the arm, and pointed to his younger self,\nintent upon his reading. Suddenly a man in foreign garments, wonderfully\nreal and distinct to look at, stood outside the window, with an axe\nstuck in his belt, and leading by the bridle an ass laden with wood.\n\n'Why, it's Ali Baba!' Scrooge exclaimed in ecstasy. 'It's dear old\nhonest Ali Baba! Yes, yes, I know. One Christmas-time, when yonder\nsolitary child was left here all alone, he _did_ come, for the first\ntime, just like that. Poor boy! And Valentine,' said Scrooge, 'and his\nwild brother, Orson; there they go! And what's his name, who was put\ndown in his drawers, asleep, at the gate of Damascus; don't you see him?\nAnd the Sultan's Groom turned upside down by the Genii; there he is upon\nhis head! Serve him right! I'm glad of it. What business had he to be\nmarried to the Princess?'\n\nTo hear Scrooge expending all the earnestness of his nature on such\nsubjects, in a most extraordinary voice between laughing and crying; and\nto see his heightened and excited face; would have been a surprise to\nhis business friends in the City, indeed.\n\n'There's the Parrot!' cried Scrooge. 'Green body and yellow tail, with a\nthing like a lettuce growing out of the top of his head; there he is!\nPoor Robin Crusoe he called him, when he came home again after sailing\nround the island. \"Poor Robin Crusoe, where have you been, Robin\nCrusoe?\" The man thought he was dreaming, but he wasn't. It was the\nParrot, you know. There goes Friday, running for his life to the little\ncreek! Halloa! Hoop! Halloo!'\n\nThen, with a rapidity of transition very foreign to his usual character,\nhe said, in pity for his former self, 'Poor boy!' and cried again.\n\n'I wish,' Scrooge muttered, putting his hand in his pocket, and looking\nabout him, after drying his eyes with his cuff; 'but it's too late now.'\n\n'What is the matter?' asked the Spirit.\n\n'Nothing,' said Scrooge. 'Nothing. There was a boy singing a Christmas\ncarol at my door last night. I should like to have given him something:\nthat's all.'\n\nThe Ghost smiled thoughtfully, and waved its hand, saying as it did so,\n'Let us see another Christmas!'\n\nScrooge's former self grew larger at the words, and the room became a\nlittle darker and more dirty. The panels shrunk, the windows cracked;\nfragments of plaster fell out of the ceiling, and the naked l\n",
